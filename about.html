                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>We're building a platform that allows digital nomads to connect and share beautiful homes around the world. 
                    Our vision is to create a community where strangers can meet online, safely share accommodations,
                    and create meaningful connections while traveling solo.</p>

                <h2>Why 'Rumahs'?</h2>
                <p>The idea for an app to help digital nomads share houses was born from my solo travels to Indonesia this past year. I had so much fun exploring but it was lonely at times. The most affordable option as a solo traveler is often hostels, but you're never sure who you'll meet. I encountered groups of friends who came together and weren’t interested in meeting new people. Sometimes, I met cool people but maybe our trips only overlapped by a day or two. I also met more outgoing people mostly looking to party, and as someone staying long-term working remotely, this wasn’t really my style. 
                <p>I wanted to stay somewhere cozier and roomier, where I could hang outside of my room, even do my own grocery shopping and cook for myself. I really wanted to stay in a home but as a solo traveler, I didn’t have the budget for it.</p>
                <p>That’s when I realized, how cool would it be if I had a group of people like me that wanted to share a villa. But where do I meet them? And if I find them, how do we find a rental together and safely split the cost? It's easy to find new friends online but logistically, it's not always easy to split the cost of a rental with people you don't know yet.</p>
                <p>This is what Rumahs is for.</p>
                <p>Before we build this, we want to know if real people would want to use this. And if you like the idea but are unsure, please let us know what might deter you so we can make the best beta version possible.</p>
                <p>We hope you’ll be on Rumahs making new friends from all over the world soon :) </p>
                
                <h2>Why We're Collecting Your Information</h2>
                <p>When you join our waitlist, we ask for three simple things:</p>
                
                <div class="info-box">
                    <h3>Email Address</h3>
                    <p>We'll use this to keep you updated on our progress and send you early access when we launch.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="info-box">
                    <h3>Facebook Profile</h3>
                    <p>This helps us understand our community better and ensures we're building something that real people actually want. 
                        We're not interested in selling data - we just want to create the best possible community.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <h3>Willingness to Pay</h3>
                    <p>This helps us understand if there's a real demand for this kind of app and if we can sustainably provide a high-quality experience for our community.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h2>What Happens Next</h2>
                <p>As we build, you'll be the first to know about:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Early access to our beta version</li>
                    <li>Any events and meetups</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2> Rumahs' Promise</h2>
                <p>We're committed to building something authentic. Your information is safe with us. 
                    We'll only use it to validate the need for this kind of app and to extend an invite to 
                    be one of the first to use Rumahs.</p>
