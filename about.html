                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>We're building a platform that allows digital nomads to connect and share beautiful homes around the world. 
                    Our vision is to create a community where strangers can meet online, safely share accommodations,
                    and create meaningful connections while traveling solo.</p>

                <h2>Why 'Rumahs'?</h2>
                <p>The idea for Rumahs was born during my solo travels through Indonesia last year. Exploring was incredible—but it could also be lonely. As a solo traveler, the most affordable options were usually hostels or coworking apartments, and who you meet there is always a gamble. Sometimes I ran into groups who weren’t interested in meeting new people. Other times, I’d connect with someone, but our trips only overlapped by a day or two. And while I met plenty of party-focused travelers, that wasn’t the lifestyle I wanted while working remotely long-term.</p>

                <p>What I really wanted was a cozy, spacious home where I could cook my own meals, relax outside my room, and still enjoy good company.</p>

                <p>That’s when I thought—how amazing would it be to share a home with other like-minded travelers? The problem was obvious: where do you find them, how do you agree on a place, and how do you safely split the cost? Meeting digital nomads online is easy; figuring out how to live together isn’t.</p>

                <p>That’s what Rumahs is for. <em>Rumah</em> means “house” or “home” in Indonesian.</p>

                <p>We’re building a platform that makes it simple for digital nomads and solo travelers to connect, find homes together, and confidently share the cost.</p>

                <p>As we build the beta, we’d love your input. If the idea excites you, join the waitlist. And if there’s something that might hold you back from using Rumahs, just reply to the confirmation email—we want to hear it.</p>

                <p>We hope to see you on Rumahs soon—making new friends and sharing beautiful homes all over the world. :)</p>
                
                <h2>Why We're Collecting Your Information</h2>
                <p>When you join our waitlist, we ask for three simple things:</p>
                
                <div class="info-box">
                    <h3>Email Address</h3>
                    <p>We'll use this to keep you updated on our progress and send you early access when we launch.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="info-box">
                    <h3>Facebook Profile</h3>
                    <p>This helps us understand our community better and ensures we're building something that real people actually want. 
                        We're not interested in selling data - we just want to create the best possible community.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <h3>Willingness to Pay</h3>
                    <p>This helps us understand if there's a real demand for this kind of app and if we can sustainably provide a high-quality experience for our community.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h2>What Happens Next</h2>
                <p>As we build, you'll be the first to know about:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Early access to our beta version</li>
                    <li>Any events and meetups</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2> Rumahs' Promise</h2>
                <p>We're committed to building something authentic. Your information is safe with us. 
                    We'll only use it to validate the need for this kind of app and to extend an invite to 
                    be one of the first to use Rumahs.</p>
