                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>WWe're building a platform that allows digital nomads to connect and share rentals around the world. Our vision is to create a community for making meaningful connections while traveling. Whether you’re an introvert or an extrovert, a surfer or a history buff, it’s a place to find a group with whom you’d want to share a <span class="semi-bold-italic">cozier (or more luxurious)</span> accommodation on your next remote adventure.</p>

                <h2>Why 'Rumahs'?</h2>
                <p>The idea for <span class="semi-bold-italic">Rumahs</span> was born during solo traveling through South East Asia. Exploring can be lonely as a solo traveler. Often, the most affordable option to stay somewhere social is in hostels or co-working spaces, but it's always a gamble who you'll meet there. Sometimes, there’s groups who aren't interested in meeting new people. Other times, you click with someone, but your trips only overlapped by a day or two. And while it’s easy to meet plenty of outgoing, party-focused travelers, it’s nice to connect with people you can kick back with.</p>

                <p>What I really wanted was a <span class="semi-bold-italic">home</span> - where I could relax outside my room and cook my own meals with good company. And I didn’t want it curated by an agency or a surf camp. I wanted to make my own friend group with people from all over the world.</p>

                <p>How cool would it be to share a home with other travelers I get along with? But where do I meet them? And how do we agree on a rental, book it and safely split the cost? Meeting people online is easy, but the logistics of renting a place together isn't.</p>

                <p>That's what <span class="semi-bold">Rumahs</span> is for.</p>

                <p>It’s a place to connect with like-minded people and book rentals as a group - no matter where you are in the world when you meet.

                <p>As we build the beta, we want your input. If the idea excites you, <span class="semi-bold-italic">join the waitlist</span>. And if something would hold you back from using <span class="semi-bold-italic">Rumahs</span>, just reply to the confirmation email because we'd love to hear it.</p>

                <p>We hope you’ll be on <i>Rumahs</i> making new friends from all over the world soon!</p>
                
                <h2>Why We're Collecting Your Information</h2>
                <p>When you join our waitlist, we ask for <span class="semi-bold">two things</span>:</p>
                
                <div class="info-box">
                    <h3>Email Address</h3>
                    <p>We'll use this to keep you updated on our progress and send you early access when we launch.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="info-box">
                    <h3>Facebook Profile</h3>
                    <p>This helps us understand our community better and ensures we're building something that <span class="semi-bold">real people</span> actually want. 
                        We'd like to create the best possible community.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h2>What Happens Next</h2>
                <p>As we build, you'll be the first to know about:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Early access to our beta version</li>
                    <li>Any events and meetups</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Rumahs' Promise</h2>
                <p>We want to build something authentic. Your information is safe with us. 
                    We'll only use it to validate the need for the app and to extend an invite to 
                    be one of the first to use Rumahs.</p>
