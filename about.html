                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>We're building a platform that allows digital nomads to connect and share beautiful homes around the world. 
                    Our vision is to create a community where strangers can meet online, safely share accommodations,
                    and create meaningful connections while traveling solo.</p>

                <h2>Why 'Rumahs'?</h2>
                <p>XXXX</p>
                
                <h2>Why We Collect This Information</h2>
                <p>When you join our waitlist, we ask for three simple things:</p>
                
                <div class="info-box">
                    <h3>Email Address</h3>
                    <p>We'll use this to keep you updated on our progress and send you early access when we launch.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="info-box">
                    <h3>Facebook Profile</h3>
                    <p>This helps us understand our community better and ensures we're building something that real people actually want. 
                        We're not interested in selling data - we just want to create the best possible community.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <h3>Willingness to Pay</h3>
                    <p>This helps us understand if there's a real demand for this kind of app and if we can sustainably provide a high-quality experience for our community.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h2>What Happens Next</h2>
                <p>As we build, you'll be the first to know about:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Early access to our beta version</li>
                    <li>Any events and meetups</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2> Rumahs' Promise</h2>
                <p>We're committed to building something authentic. Your information is safe with us. 
                    We'll only use it to validate the need for this kind of app and to extend an invite to 
                    be one of the first to use Rumahs.</p>
