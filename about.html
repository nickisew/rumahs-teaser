                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>We're building a platform that allows digital nomads to connect and share beautiful homes around the world. 
                    Our vision is to create a community where strangers can meet online, safely share accommodations,
                    and create meaningful connections while traveling solo.</p>

                <h2>Why 'Rumahs'?</h2>
                <p>The idea for this app to connect digital nomads was born from my solo travels to Indonesia this past year. I was having so much fun exploring but it got a little lonely. The most affordable option as a solo traveler was hostels, but I was never sure who I would meet. I encountered a lot of groups of friends who came together and weren’t interested in meeting new people. Sometimes, I met cool people but maybe they were only there for a short time, or I met someone I really got along with a day before their month-long trip was coming to an end. I also met a lot of people vacationing mostly to go clubbing or party, which as someone staying long-term in the country doing remote work, wasn’t really my style. I also wanted to stay somewhere a bit cozier and roomier, where I could hang out outside of my room, do my own shopping and cook - I really wanted to stay in a home but as a solo traveler, I didn’t have the budget for that.</p>
                <p>That’s when I realized, how cool would it be if I had a group of people like me that wanted to share a villa together. But where do I meet them? And if I did find a group and a place to rent, how do I safely split the cost with them?.</p>
                <p>This is what Rumahs is for.</p>
                <p>Before we build this, we want to know if real people would want or use this. And if you like the idea but are a bit unsure, please let us know anything that might deter you from wanting to try the beta version. We hope you’ll be on Rumahs making new friends from all over the world soon :) </p>
                
                <h2>Why We're Collecting Your Information</h2>
                <p>When you join our waitlist, we ask for three simple things:</p>
                
                <div class="info-box">
                    <h3>Email Address</h3>
                    <p>We'll use this to keep you updated on our progress and send you early access when we launch.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="info-box">
                    <h3>Facebook Profile</h3>
                    <p>This helps us understand our community better and ensures we're building something that real people actually want. 
                        We're not interested in selling data - we just want to create the best possible community.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <h3>Willingness to Pay</h3>
                    <p>This helps us understand if there's a real demand for this kind of app and if we can sustainably provide a high-quality experience for our community.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h2>What Happens Next</h2>
                <p>As we build, you'll be the first to know about:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Early access to our beta version</li>
                    <li>Any events and meetups</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2> Rumahs' Promise</h2>
                <p>We're committed to building something authentic. Your information is safe with us. 
                    We'll only use it to validate the need for this kind of app and to extend an invite to 
                    be one of the first to use Rumahs.</p>
