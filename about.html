                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>We're building a platform that allows digital nomads to connect and share beautiful homes around the world. 
                    Our vision is to create a community where strangers can meet online, safely share accommodations,
                    and create meaningful connections while traveling solo.</p>

                <h2>Why 'Rumahs'?</h2>
                <p>The idea for <span class="semi-bold">Rumahs</span> was born during my solo travels through South East Asia last year. I loved exploring, but it could be lonely. As a solo traveler, the most affordable option is usually hostels or coworking apartments, but it's always a gamble who you'll meet. Sometimes, there's groups who aren't interested in meeting new people. Other times, you click with someone, but your trips only overlapped by a day or two. And while I met plenty of really fun outgoing, party-focused travelers, I wanted to connect with people I could kick back with.</p>

                <p>What I really wanted was a <span class="semi-bold">home</span> - where I could relax outside my room and cook my own meals with good company.</p>

                <p>That's when I realized how cool it would be to share a home with other <span class="semi-bold">like-minded</span> travelers. But then came the questions of where do I find them, how do we agree on a place, and how do we safely split the cost? Meeting people online is easy, but figuring out the logistics of renting a place together isn't.</p>

                <p>That's what <span class="semi-bold">Rumahs</span> is for. <em>Rumah</em> means "house" or "home" in Indonesian.</p>

                <p>We're building a platform that makes it <span class="semi-bold">simple</span> for digital nomads and other travelers to connect, find homes together, and <span class="semi-bold">confidently</span> share the cost.</p>

                <p>As we build the beta, we want your input. If the idea excites you, <span class="semi-bold">join the waitlist</span>. And if something would hold you back from using <span class="semi-bold">Rumahs</span>, just reply to the confirmation email because we'd love to hear it.</p>

                <p>We hope you’ll be on <i>Rumahs</i> making new friends from all over the world soon!</p>
                
                <h2>Why We're Collecting Your Information</h2>
                <p>When you join our waitlist, we ask for <span class="semi-bold">two things</span>:</p>
                
                <div class="info-box">
                    <h3>Email Address</h3>
                    <p>We'll use this to keep you updated on our progress and send you early access when we launch.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="info-box">
                    <h3>Facebook Profile</h3>
                    <p>This helps us understand our community better and ensures we're building something that <span class="semi-bold">real people</span> actually want. 
                        We're not interested in selling data. We just want to create the best possible community.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h2>What Happens Next</h2>
                <p>As we build, you'll be the first to know about:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Early access to our beta version</li>
                    <li>Any events and meetups</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Rumahs' Promise</h2>
                <p>We're committed to building something authentic. Your information is safe with us. 
                    We'll only use it to validate the need for this kind of app and to extend an invite to 
                    be one of the first to use <span class="semi-bold">Rumahs</span>.</p>
